                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am a professional cellist turned web developer with the goal of creating and developing web apps that would improve and simplify the day to day activities of my clients. In my music teaching life I kept saying to myself “this problem could be solved with a well designed app…” and decided to do something about it so I became a software developer! Music also allowed me to develop my communication and collaboration skills through numerous, sometimes too much so, rehearsals in groups varying from a handful up to a couple hundred or so.</p>
